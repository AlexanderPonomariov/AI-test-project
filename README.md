# React Contact Form Application

This is a simple React application that provides a contact form where users can enter their `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and a `message`. Upon submission, the details are validated to ensure that each field is correctly filled out. After a successful submission, the user's details are displayed in a table format below the form.

The primary purpose of this application is to showcase the integration of a form in a React application, demonstrate form validation, and present the submitted data in a neat table format. Whether you're a beginner trying to understand the basics of form handling in React or a developer looking to integrate a similar feature, this repository provides a straightforward implementation.
